## 🤔 What's Kyverno?
_Kyverno is a Kubernetes native policy engine where the policies are basically managed as Kubernetes resources. The kyverno policies can **Generate**, **Mutate**, and **Validate** kubernetes resources. With the **Kyverno CLI**, we can test policies and validate resources through a CI/CD pipeline._

## 💻 Project Abstract
### **"Extend `kyverno test` command to cover generate policies & improve test coverage"** <br>
1. _Currently the **kyverno test** command covers only the `validate` and `mutate` policies but not the `generate` policy. So, my task will be to extend the **Kyverno CLI** or the `kyverno test` command to cover `generate` policies as well._ <br>
2. _Secondly, I've to work on improving the test coverage of Kyverno._
3. _To generate a test report for each PR_ [(demo)](https://github.com/kyverno/policy-reporter/pull/53#issuecomment-895424095)
